<span style="color:blue">*Have you ever dreamt of freedom?*</span>

You have! And you definitely not believe that Apple does, themselves!  You most likely believe that most of your userspace is closed-source (and has been for many years), and  your kernel, although 90% opensource, doesn't like your opinion:

![PRs](../img/PRs_not_accepted.jpeg){: .align-center}

If you take a closer look, you'll realise that 90% of the PRs are gibberish (sorry fellow devs), (some of them even re-introduce already-patched vurnerabilities, see [#6](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/pull/6)), but the rest 10% of them are actually pretty good.

For example [this](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/pull/16) PR.

If you trully believe that apple and should start caring about the true essence of opensource, checkout community-xnu.

community-XNU is what I envisioned as a semi-official XNU, with the following goals:
- up-to-date with upstream
- all PRs submitted to apple's repo be reviewed and merged if appropriate
