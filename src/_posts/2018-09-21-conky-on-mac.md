<span style="color:blue">*Everything began with my encounter with Linux. ...Then it all happened fast*</span>

I grasped the idea of having conky on the mac -for the first time- when I was 14 years old.  Back then I had too little knowledge of programming languages and computers in general.  All I could do was visualise how awesome would it be using it on the platform I loved.  It didn't just start there though.

Everything began with my encounter with Linux.  When I saw an old CD of Manjaro in my father's office, I asked him to burn me a copy of Linux and some days later he handed me a CD with the newest version of Ubuntu.  I installed it immediately on my (then) PC and started tinkering with it.  From that point, it all happened fast:  First the introduction to the Unix world where everything worked differently from Windows and mostly everything was great, then the introduction to programming (C/C++) and ofcourse conky.

Fast forward 4 years and there it was: conky was making its first steps into the apple platform.  First I had to get it to build, then link, then rule out everything that wasn't working and keep everything that did, and finally, the most difficult part: implement missing functionality while based on the linux implementation.

conky was officially ported to macOS at **4 July 2018**, when [my first pull request](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/pull/480) was merged into upstream bringing basic compatibility with macOS.

One thing brought the other and one year later from the day I began the port, conky supported multi-core CPU statistics, memory statistics and some cool macOS-specific features.

This is how it looks right now:
