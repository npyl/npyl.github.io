Hey !!<br>

## Experience:
- ported an opensource system monitor (conky) to macOS

- learning about system internals and system APIs to access memory, cpu and disk statistics
- strict testing with tools such as Xcode's Instruments
- creator of opensource project ManageConky (a widget manager for the conky system monitor)
